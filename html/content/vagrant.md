Hi there, I've been working with  <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>  for a year, by now, and I'm very imprest!

In my opinion the perfect tool for build virtual environment and even production why not?

Here you might want to check my repo <a href="https://github.com/Eddie-Uncle/Vagrant" target="_blank">Eddie Uncle VagrantFiles</a> for your reference and usage, I'm using VirtualBox by the way and is very handy when comes to set up a quick and efficient environment. You might want to combine with your CM (Configuration Management) favorite tool like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt, whatever. In this example, I have provisioning with <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>. Feel free to make your pick.

Other than that, you can find several boxes ready for use on the <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-18.04" target="_blank">Vagrant Bento Boxes</a>. You might go ahead and check for yourself.

Other than that, here it goes a tool definitely you should know, is <a href="https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html" target="_blank">Hashicorp Packer</a>, but we can discuss this one later on!

Hope you like it.

Cheers.
