#Terraform apply



Find the **link** below, Terraform forked recipe to create basic EC2 instances on AWS.

Very handy in order to create easily and straightforward cloud instances.

If you dig deeper, you'll find **main.tf** and **variables.tf** and all you have to do is a change in order to fit your environment. 

You can create, refresh, destroy instances at a glance.




Feel free and check this out:
