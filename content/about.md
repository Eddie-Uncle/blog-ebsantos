*My thoughts:*

For one, self-criticism. There are literally millions of far better writers than I will ever be. English is not my 1st language, so is my writing sufficiently readable, enjoyable even?

Can I find some original topics to cover, which don’t already have tons of brilliant coverage on other blogs or other mediums? And the list could go on forever…

But.

If I don’t expose my writing to critics, how will I get better? Who can give my point of view to topics maybe already covered? Could I even add something new to previous views?

Just to finish, I have some hobbies like music, writing, and photography! Pretty much that's it.
